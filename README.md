# Spherical Cube Map Rendering

SCM is a C++ class library that implements a non-homogeneous data representation and rendering engine for the interactive display of spherical data sets at scales of hundreds of gigapixels and beyond. Applications include panoramic image display and planetary rendering. The SCM data representation enables out-of-core data access at real-time rates. The spherical geometry tessellator supports displacement mapping and enables the display of planetary terrain data of arbitrary resolution.
